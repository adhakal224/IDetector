#IDetector is an application that allows users to navigate their computer using just their eye gestures.
#It was build in the Vanderbilt Hackathon 2019 by me and my team.
#The project uses openCV to process feed from camera and dlib library for image detection.
#This project won third place in the Vanderbilt Hackathon.
#You can see a demo of me playing a game using our software in the devpost link below
